\subsection{Conclusions}
\label{sec:sec_conc}
This work describes a novel approach delivering a MapReduce based $k$-NN probabilistic classifier. Firstly, we applied data dimensionality reduction and ensured efficient data sorting and distance computations. We proceeded by performing data partitioning and pre-calculation, which fed the $k$-NN based data classification process. Lastly, we conducted an experimental evaluation to assess the algorithm w.r.t forecasting, prediction precision and useful knowledge extraction.

The directions for future work include the performance comparison of the the F-zkNN algorithm with other similar approaches to draw useful conclusions and quantify its efficiency in terms of scalability and execution time. Further experimental investigations will focus on the improvement of classifier's precision and the dynamic determination of the consumption classes by exploiting the data characteristics.
