\subsection{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper, we addressed the problems of pair and bundle discovery over co-evolving time series, according to their local similarity. We introduced two efficient algorithms for pair and bundle discovery that utilize checkpoints appropriately placed across the time axis in order to aggressively prune the search space and avoid expensive exhaustive search at each timestamp. Our methods successfully detect locally similar subsequences of co-evolving time series, as demonstrated in our experimental evaluation over real-world and synthetic data. Also, they were orders of magnitude faster compared to baseline methods that apply a sweep line approach, confirming their effectiveness in pair and bundle discovery. In the future, we plan to further improve the scalability of our algorithms to extend their applicability over very large time series datasets, both in terms of cardinality, as well as in terms of length.
